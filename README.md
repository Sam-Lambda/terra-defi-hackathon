## Description
We are building an app for the anchor protocol that automatically manages your collateral to prevent margin call

- Anchor protocol
    - Allows users to deposit money and borrow money

- Problem:
    - Whenever you borrow money, you always run into the risk of being liquidated due to market fluctuations
    - Requires a lot of time and energy to manage

- Solution:
    - Automatically manage the funds
        - Users will be able to pick your collateral ratio
            - Example: For each one dollar of debt, we have two dollars worth of collateral
